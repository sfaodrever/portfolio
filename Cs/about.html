            <p>I started coding in middle school, and I was interested in various activities. When I was in high school, I immigrated to the United States by myself. As soon as I arrived, I finished computer science in course, and with the teacher's recommendation, I took AP computer science right away, and I finished all of them with A's. I tried and made some project with a lot of language. My main language is C++ and HTML, also JAVA</p>
